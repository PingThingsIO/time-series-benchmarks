# Plots Comparing Various Metrics Over Different Databases

###

In the below plot, FullParallelInsert.MPPS (shown along the x axis) is compared across the databases: influx, predictivegrid, and timescale. The parameters: SequentialReadParallelNum, InsertNumStreams, InsertSpanSeconds, Insert32Bit, InsertSubsample, InsertTSJitter, and InsertBatchSize were controlled for and are given along the y axis.
